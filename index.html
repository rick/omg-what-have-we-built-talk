<h3>There are different understandings of your world throughout your organization</h3>

<h3>Landed into Engineering as a &quot;Principal Engineer&quot;</h3>

<p><br/></p>

<h3>Since all the engineering leads were already, well, leading, I got the opportunity to just roam around for a bit looking at how things work.</h3>

<p><br/></p>

<h3>(Also, given that I had a history of being a &quot;rescuer&quot;, pretty sure no one really wanted me on their team, hahaha)</h3>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h3>So I hung out with the &quot;Integration&quot; team</h3>

<p><br/></p>

<h3>Which is a team of heavy hitters charged with cleaning up whatever comes downstream from the rest of engineering and needs to work well in the released product.</h3>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p><img src="images/bottlenecks.png" alt=""></p>

<h3>Lots of bottlenecks and process failures</h3>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h3>A more classic cousin of Conway&#39;s Law...</h3>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h3>At some point QA, release engineering, and test automation were moved out into a separate division of Engineering</h3>

<p><br/></p>

<h3>As a result, eventually developers did not own how their software was tested, how it was built, how it came together for release</h3>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h3><strong>Lots of things went &quot;over the wall&quot;</strong></h3>

<p><br/></p>

<h3>Feedback loops got long, developers were unempowered, product releases slowed down, frustration and finger-pointing escalated</h3>

<p><br/></p>

<h3>My hazy understanding: Release engineering eventually got sick of fixing software thrown over the wall, and so the Integration team was born (closer to home, but still &quot;over the fence&quot;)</h3>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h3>In early 2014 there were technical attempts to fix problems, starting with the CI (test) system, but the efforts petered out with no significant change</h3>

<p><br/></p>

<h3>In early 2015 there were &quot;proof of concept&quot; experiments (like we&#39;d done at GitHub with permissioning systems), but they never moved forward</h3>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h3><strong>The fundamental problems were organizational</strong></h3>

<p><br/></p>

<h3>Interpersonal and team dynamics that persist over years</h3>

<h3>Self-reinforcing patterns of behavior that prevent real change from happening</h3>

<h3>Siloing of teams with thick walls preventing cross-cutting change</h3>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>What now?</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h3>We moved testing pipeline definition into version control and made it more self-service</h3>

<p><br/></p>

<h3>This only took a little concensus building, and the stability benefits were obvious</h3>

<p><br/></p>

<h3>The side effect is that it makes developers more involved in the testing cycle (it&#39;s less over-the-wall)</h3>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h3>We started a cross-functional group called The Pit Crew which brings in high-level engineers and test/release folks</h3>

<p><br/></p>

<h3>It is HIGHLY transparent (more so than any other high-level group in the company)</h3>

<p><br/></p>

<h3>Its mandate is to find the biggest bottlenecks in the development-to-release cycle and have actual teams prioritize those fixes</h3>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h3>For this we had to build high-level consensus that these fixes were necessary to deliver product in the future (because this effort pushes back on product feature work!)</h3>

<p><br/></p>

<h3>The proof of the commitment is that we already have big bottlenecks being tackled by real people</h3>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h3>We are rolling out a long-term (1 year+) revamp of our CI/build/release infrastructure</h3>

<p><br/></p>

<h3>We need to alleviate fundamental performance and capacity problems</h3>

<h3>We need to address deep UX problems, and to make it even more self-service</h3>
